          The Kansas state fire marshal issued a rare cease-and-desist order for construction of a Lenexa surgical center, citing serious problems with the centerâ€™s design and sterility.
  Doug Jorgensen lifted the order last month after the Minimially Invasive Surgical Hospital and Clinics agreed to keep the systems for medical gas, fire alarms and sprinklers uncovered until his office had inspected and approved them.
  Jorgensen, reached by phone in Topeka, said his office does inspections every day and seldom has to issue such an order.
